This is the implementation of Phase 1: Simple TwiML PhoneBuzz
using Python and Flask. This web application is hosted on 
Heroku. 

The X-Twilio-Signature header is also validated to ensure that 
only Twilio can use the URL at http://phonebuzz-phase1.herokuapp.com
so an authentication token may be need to be provided in the 
app.py file.
